## Hi there, I'm SirScotterington! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student who does a fair amount of coding and playing around with Arudinos (go figure). Currently learning how to use PHP and MySQL as part of a LAMP stack and how to use React, Tailwind CSS, and more through NextJS. Always looking to learn new things about programming, engineering, or music playing.
